# Self-Weight Load

A nested class within Load used to create self-weight loads.

## Constructor
---
**<font color="green">`Load.SW(load_case, dir = "Z", value = -1, load_group = "")`</font>**

Creates a self-weight load for the specified load case.

### Parameters
* `load_case`: Name of the load case
* `dir (default="Z")`: Direction of self-weight ("X", "Y", or "Z")
* `value (default=-1)`: Magnitude of self-weight (can be int or list [FX, FY, FZ])
* `load_group (default="")`: Load group name

### Object Attributes
* `LC` (str): The name of the load case.
* `DIR` (str): The direction of the self-weight ("X", "Y", or "Z").
* `FV` (list): A list of three floats representing the load factors in X, Y, and Z directions.
* `LG` (str): The name of the load group.

## Methods
---
#### json

```py
sw1 = Load.SW("Dead Load", "Z", -1)
print(Load.SW.json())
```

#### create
Sends self-weight loads to Civil NX.

```py
Load.SW.create()
```

#### get
Fetches self-weight loads from Civil NX.

```py
print(Load.SW.get())
```

#### sync
Synchronizes self-weight loads from Civil NX.

```py
Load.SW.sync()
```

#### delete
Deletes all self-weight loads from both Python and Civil NX.

## Examples
---
```py
# Simple self-weight in Z direction
for i in range(2):
    Node(i*10,0,0)
    Node.create()

Element.Beam(1,2)
Element.create()
    
#Load Case
Load_Case("D","SW Load")
Load_Case.create()

Load.SW("SW Load","Z",-1)
Load.SW.create()

```
